# Recipes-Search
A quick python3 program that uses Spoonacular API to help you find a food recipe you'd like and also help you find substitute for certain ingredients.
When running the main program you need to paste your Spoonacular API key in the header (where it says "YOUR KEY HERE"). To get one you need to subscribe to the API on rapidapi.com.
