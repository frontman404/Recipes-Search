# Recipes-Search
A program written in Python3 that you can use to search for a food recipe. Running the main program will display a couple of questions and, based on the answers, it will provide one or more recipes from which you can choose the one you prefer. After that it will display the ingredients and instructions. You have the option to search for a substitute ingredient if needed.
Before running the main program you need to paste your Spoonacular API key in the header (where it says "YOUR KEY HERE"). To get one you need to subscribe to the API on rapidapi.com.
